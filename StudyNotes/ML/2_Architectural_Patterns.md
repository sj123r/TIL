### Reactive Systems

- Responsive: reacts in a timely manner.
- Resilient: system remains responsive to errors.
- Message Driven: relies on asynchronous message passing.
- Elastic: system stays responsive under varying load.

> IMO: focused more on stability & sustainability

Ex: React

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Service Provider | publishes a contract that specifies the nature of the service and how to use it. |
| Service Customer | can locate the service metadata in the registry and develop the required client components to bind to it and use it. |
| Orchestrator | a composite service which is responsible for invoking and combining other services |
| Choreography | decentralized approach for service composition, i.e. services interact with the exchange of messages/events. |
